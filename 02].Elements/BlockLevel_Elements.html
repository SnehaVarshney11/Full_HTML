    <!-- Formatted paragraph -->
    <p>
        This is the first paragraph in the example about the P tag. There really
        isn't much to say here.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        This is the second paragraph. Again, more of the same. This time the
        paragraph is aligned in the center. This might not be such a good idea as
        it makes the text hard to read.
      </p>
      <p align="right">
        Here the paragraph is aligned to the right. Right-aligned text is also
        troublesome to read. The rest of the text of this paragraph is of little
        importance.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        Under HTML 4.0-compliant browsers, you are able to justify text. As you
        may notice, the way browsers tend to justify text is sometimes imprecise.
        Furthermore, not all browsers support this attribute value.
      </p>

      <pre> 
        This is            an            example of 
              text with a        lot of
                                curious
                                white space.

        <p>
        This is             a            example of 
              text with a         lot of
                                  curious
                                  white space.

        <!-- BlockQuote Tag  -->
        <blockquote>Browsers generally render blockquote text as indented text. If your
            quoted text needs to display within a non-quoted paragraph, you should use the
            HTML q tag. Most browsers surround q text with quotation marks.</blockquote>
        <q>Browsers generally render blockquote text as indented text. If your quoted 
            text needs to display within a non-quoted paragraph, you should use the HTML q 
            tag. Most browsers surround q text with quotation marks.</q>
